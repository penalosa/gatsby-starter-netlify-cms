  Dedicated to the roots of hip hop, the Dizzy Show is all about the backstories

  and the culture of what is rap. Spanning from coast to coast of America, to
  the

  British rap scene and beyond, to having locals live broadcasting their own
  music

  on the air; delving into the archives of jazz, RnB, blues, motown
  influences...

  each week will be unpacking a different side of the history of hip hop. 


  Saturdays from 6pm - 7pm on FreshAir.
