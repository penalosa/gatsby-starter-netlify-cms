  It's a fun, relaxed show, with discussions ranging from drag, to identity, to

  how to live life as your best self. It's a queer show, for queer (and
  straight)

  people to listen to, enjoy good music and every now and then there will be
  queer

  guests! So, if you're working on a fun art project, got something to say about
  a

  queer issue or just wanting to chat about queer literature - then get in
  touch!

  Follow us on twitter @HourQueer and we'll get back to you soon!
