  A show to commemorate the happenings of our contemporary world; all of its

  hardships, happiness, and harmonies. I will be bringing on regular guests to

  discuss contemporary environmental issues as well as to share music and poetry

  that make us all feel some type of way. This will be a show combining current

  events, politics, and sustainability along with music that relates to the
  topics

  we will be discussing as well as tunes to allow the listener a bit of a
  breather

  to reflect on what was discussed.
