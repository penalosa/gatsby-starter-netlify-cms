description: "All you need to know in a shot! Get ready for some good tunes and some not so\ngood news. \_Each week we take a major news story or issue and break down the\nhistorical and cultural context from which it has arisen, whether it’s the\npersonal lives of politicians or democracy in Hong Kong, providing a basis for\ndiscussion and opinion-forming that challenges the click-bait culture of current\naffairs. Having framed the issue, we discuss ‘What’s happening now’, setting out\nand unpicking the situation in the present moment. It’s a newsroom with a\nbackroom, talking through not only what’s going on, but what we can make of it.\nHeadline news has a history. \_Espresso Adulting takes the big issues you thought\nyou’d be mulling over at dinner parties and distils them into a must-listen\none-hour audio brief. It’s a strong grounding delivered in a speedy sip. It’s\nall you need to know in a single shot."
