  Spins and Needles curates rock n roll selections from “back in my day,” hosted

  by Julianna Ritzu and produced by Orlando Low; two people without the life

  experience to understand what that saying truly means. Guided by a theme each

  week, we will be bringing you a playlist of tunes to suit the occasion,
  covering

  buddy holly to bikini kill. So tune in and enjoy good music and unsolicited

  musical opinions from someone who should have had her mic turned off a long
  time

  ago.
