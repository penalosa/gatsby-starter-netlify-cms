  The age of 8tracks was a simpler time. The wise few who know 8tracks can

  reminisce for an hour of nostalgia and those who clearly lacked taste in their

  teen years can receive a musical education. Each week a new painfully specific

  playlist revolving around a painfully specific scenario which always manages
  to

  have Lana del Rey's Born To Die in there somewhere.
