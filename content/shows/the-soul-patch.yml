  Rare & Exquisite Soul, Funk, and Classic Hip-hop. An extension of a show that
  I

  did at Bowdoin College during undergraduate study. May include occasional

  guests, show will also include brief explanatory tidbits of background

  information regarding some of the music played. The idea is fun energy
  entering

  the weekend on a Friday afternoon! (as was the slot at Bowdoin)
