  DissTopia will bring on a rotating guestlist of 4th year students from all

  disciplines to introduce their dissertation focus, DISScuss (sorry) what drew

  them to that topic, and reveal all the interesting things they've learnt about

  it since. The idea is to showcase the wacky and wonderful research being
  carried

  out by undergraduates across the university behind closed macbooks. Think ‘In

  Our Time with Melvynn Bragg’.. but with me instead of Melvynn Bragg,

  undergraduates rather than renowned experts, and Edinburgh as the only

  contributing academic centre.
