  Disarray: A state of disorganisation. Otherwise known as the ending of my

  university life. Two birds, one stone. Discussing issues causing disarray:
  from

  graduate jobs, to house mates, to moving back in with the parents. Iâ€™ve been

  there, done that, albeit not always well; but I do have a tale to tell. Mixed
  in

  with my love for an unrestricted array of music. Be a folk & country dedicate,

  and a house worshipper. Not categories here. So What You Waiting For? Spice Up

  Your Life - Miss Independent - because Baby You Were Born to Run.
